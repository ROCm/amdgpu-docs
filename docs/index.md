# AMD GPU Driver

The AMD GPU driver is an open-source software. It is a key element in the software ecosystems (ROCm user space, AMD GPU virtualization and frameworks) that allows powerful AMD GPUs in data centers to function optimally for AI & HPC applications workloads.

This site documents the features and capabilities of the AMD GPU driver, installation, and compatibility information.

The AMD Instinct documentation is organized into the following categories:
