# Data Center GPU driver 30.10 release notes

## Release highlights

The following are notable new features and improvements in Instinct Driver 30.10. Refer to [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes) for additional details.

### Operating system and hardware support changes

The Instinct driver 30.10 adds support for [AMD Instinct MI355X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi350/mi355x.html), [MI350X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/instinct/mi350/mi350x.html), and [AMD Radeon RX9060](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/9000-series/amd-radeon-rx-9060.html).

Instinct Driver 30.10 introduces support for the following operating systems and kernel versions:

* Rocky 9
* Ubuntu 24.04.3

Instinct driver 30.10 marks end-of-support (EOS) for Ubuntu 24.04.2.

### ROCm compatibility matrix

#### Software version

The Instinct Driver 30.10 is compatible with ROCm 7.0 and ROCm 6.4.

#### Operating system and kernel version

See [Supported operating systems](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-operating-systems) for ROCm supported operating systems and their kernel versions.

#### GPU support

See [Supported GPUs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus) for the list of supported AMD Instinct™ accelerators, Radeon™ PRO, and Radeon GPUs.

### New features

* Added support for the following partitioning modes:
    * CPX + NPS4 for AMD Instinct MI300X
    * NPS1 + SPX for AMD Instinct MI355X
    * NPS2 + DPX for AMD Instinct MI355X

* Added SDMA engine reset to support finer-grain GPU resiliency.

## Detailed component changes

### Partitioning

#### Added

The Instinct Driver 30.10 adds the following memory and compute partitioning support:

* **NPS1 + SPX partitioning for AMD Instinct MI355X**: This memory partitioning mode exposes the entire memory to all compute dies (XCDs), allowing full access across the GPU. In SPX (Single Partition Compute Mode), workgroups are distributed round-robin across all XCDs. There’s no explicit control over which XCD executes a given kernel, making it simple and general-purpose. This feature requires BKC 25.04.

* **NPS2 + DPX partitioning for AMD Instinct MI355X**: NPS2 splits the GPU’s memory into two NUMA domains. Dual Partition Compute Mode (DPX) divides the GPU’s compute resources into two partitions, each with 4 XCDs (out of 8 total), 8 DMA engines, and 2 VCN decoder groups. This feature requires BKC 25.07.


### GPU resiliency

#### Added

The following GPU resiliency features are supported in the Instinct Driver 30.10 for AMD Instinct MI355X and MI300X:

* SDMA engine reset enables recovery from SDMA-related faults without requiring a full GPU reset, improving system stability and fault tolerance.

### PC Sampling for MI355

Stochastic (hardware-based) and Host-trap PC sampling has been enabled for AMD Instinct MI355X.

## Instinct driver resolved issues

* Issue with restoring a CRIU checkpoint for workloads on AMD Instinct MI series GPUs.

* Wrong severity level was set for a Common Platform Error Record (CPER) when the bad page threshold exceeded. This issue was common across all AMD Instinct MI3xx series GPUs.
