----------------

The AMD Instinct™ MI300A Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) represents a major architectural advancement in AMD’s Compute DNA (CDNA) portfolio. As AMD’s first fully integrated CPU+GPU APU designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, the MI300A combines the power of Zen 4 CPU cores with CDNA3 GPU compute units and high-bandwidth HBM3 memory into a single unified package. This integration delivers significant benefits over traditional discrete CPU-GPU systems by eliminating performance bottlenecks & memory bandwidth bottlenecks, reducing data movement overhead, addressing programmability overhead, and the need to refactor code for new hardware generations.

The MI300A introduces a fully coherent, unified memory architecture, enabling CPU and GPU components to share data and cache efficiently, simplifying software development and improving runtime performance. By tightly integrating high-performance “Zen4” CPU cores with high-throughput GPU Compute Units (CUs) and 128GB of unified HBM3 memory into a single socket with hardware-supported cache coherence, the MI300A APU eliminates the data movement penalties commonly associated with discrete architectures. Through architectural innovations like shared last-level cache (LLC), cache-coherent memory access, direct CPU-GPU fabric interconnects, seamless task delegation across CPU and GPU, synchronization across compute domain, and support for hardware sparsity, MI300A is optimized to accelerate the convergence of HPC and AI at exascale.

These architectural innovations are supported by AMD’s ROCm™ open software platform, which provides a consistent programming model for heterogeneous compute. The result is a single-package solution that delivers exceptional energy efficiency, programmability, and performance density — enabling next-generation exascale systems to tackle converged HPC and AI workloads with reduced complexity and improved throughput.

This architectural design provides the foundation for software-defined partitioning and workload orchestration — enabling MI300A to deliver balanced compute, memory, and I/O performance for the next era of converged HPC and AI workloads.



3. Partitioning Concepts
-------------------------

a. Compute Partitioning (SPX, TPX, CPX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compute partitioning on the MI300A APU enables fine-grained resource management by dividing GPU compute resources into multiple logical devices, allowing users to optimize for workload isolation, parallel execution, and resource efficiency. Unlike discrete GPU solutions, the MI300A architecture unifies CPU, GPU, and memory into a single coherent address space backed by high-bandwidth HBM3. This allows partitioned workloads to share memory more seamlessly while benefiting from high interconnect bandwidth and cache coherence.

MI300A supports the following compute partitioning modes:

- **SPX (Single Partition X-celerator):** All GPU XCDs are grouped as a single monolithic device.
- **TPX (Triple Partition X-celerator):** The GPU complex is divided into three partitions, each containing two XCDs.
- **CPX (Core Partitioned X-celerator):** Each of the six XCDs is treated as a separate logical device.

All partitioning is managed at the driver level and can be reconfigured dynamically using utilities such as ``amd-smi``. These modes enable flexible workload orchestration strategies ranging from unified execution (SPX) to strict isolation (CPX).

**Key Benefits of Compute Partitioning:**

- Enables multi-tenancy and workload isolation.
- Provides better scheduling granularity and performance tuning.
- Optimizes resource utilization across mixed workloads.
- Reduces contention and minimizes performance variability.

**Partitioning Rules and Notes:**

- MI300A includes 6 GPU XCDs per socket; partitions must use physically grouped XCDs.
- Each partition is assigned an equal number of Compute Units (CUs) and interleaved access to the unified HBM pool.
- Partitioning is spatial (hardware-aware) and operates at the kernel driver level, independent of virtualization or container runtimes.
- In MI300A only **NPS1** (NUMA Per Socket) is available, where all HBM stacks are uniformly interleaved.

4. Benefits of Partitioning (MI300A APU)
----------------------------------------

Partitioning in the MI300A APU—enabled via SPX, TPX, and CPX modes—offers a flexible architecture that balances unified memory access with compute isolation. These modes allow system architects to tune performance, resource efficiency, and workload isolation on heterogeneous CPU+GPU platforms.

- **CPX mode in MI300A** enables fine-grained control over the GPU compute fabric by exposing each XCD as a distinct logical GPU. When paired with memory locality-aware execution, CPX mode enhances *parallelism*, *isolation*, and *throughput* for multi-user or multi-tenant systems, particularly in **high-performance computing (HPC)** and **cloud-native inference** environments.

- **TPX mode** serves as a *balanced hybrid mode*, exposing 4 partitions with 2 XCDs each. This is especially beneficial for mid-sized models or workloads that demand more compute capacity and memory than a single XCD can provide, while still requiring workload separation. TPX enables *optimal use of shared CPU and GPU resources*, and aligns well with the shared-memory design of the MI300A APU.

- Partitioning at the compute level enables **dynamic workload management**, where different applications or user sessions can be mapped to different GPU partitions, without interference or scheduling conflicts. This is a key enabler for *simultaneous AI, HPC, and mixed-precision scientific workloads*.

- **Memory-coherent interconnects** in MI300A ensure that each partition can maintain high-bandwidth, low-latency communication with the CPU and system memory. Even when GPUs are logically isolated via CPX, partitions retain access to the shared HBM and DDR memory pools through the CPU’s memory controller, simplifying software complexity for multi-GPU workloads.

- Partitioning also plays a crucial role in **fault containment and serviceability**. In the event of a GPU partition failure, workloads in other partitions can continue unaffected, enhancing system uptime and reducing recovery overheads.

- **Driver-level flexibility** allows runtime switching between SPX, TPX, and CPX modes (subject to reboot in some configurations), enabling operators to adapt the system to workload needs without hardware reconfiguration.

- On MI300A, GPU partitioning also interacts closely with **HMM (Heterogeneous Memory Management)** and **Shared Virtual Memory (SVM)**, enabling user applications to seamlessly share pointers and memory structures across CPU and GPU partitions. This allows for a *unified programming model* that reduces developer complexity and increases code portability.

.. note::

   On MI300A, while **SPX remains the default mode**, CPX and TPX offer compelling benefits for *multi-process environments*, *scientific workflows*, and *latency-sensitive inference* pipelines. Administrators should carefully benchmark their workloads across modes to identify the optimal configuration.
