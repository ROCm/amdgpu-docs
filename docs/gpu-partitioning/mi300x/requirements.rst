Requirements to Partition MI300X GPUs
======================================

Partitioning AMD Instinct™ MI300X GPUs is a critical enabler for modern heterogeneous computing environments where isolation, resource sharing, and workload-specific optimization are paramount. By dividing a single physical GPU into multiple logical partitions, developers and system administrators can tailor computational resources to meet the unique performance, memory, and security demands of diverse applications—including large-scale AI inference, training, HPC simulations, and cloud-native deployments.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system, software, and firmware requirements needed to successfully configure and operate GPU partitioning on MI300X devices. Partitioning support for the MI300X platform is tightly integrated with the ROCm software stack and relies on both hardware-level and OS-level infrastructure. As such, careful attention must be given to platform readiness, including validated driver versions, kernel support, supported memory modes, and compatibility with partitioning utilities such as `amd-smi`.

Users should ensure their system environment meets all listed prerequisites prior to attempting partition configuration. Failure to do so may result in incomplete GPU enumeration, missing partitioning capabilities, or instability during execution.

This guide is intended for system integrators, developers, platform architects, and IT administrators tasked with deploying MI300X-based platforms in bare-metal, production-grade environments. All configurations, tools, and commands referenced herein have been validated on supported operating systems and are based on ROCm version 6.4 or newer.

1. Prerequisites
-----------------

- MI300X GPUs must be installed and recognized by the system.
- ROCm stack must be correctly installed.
- Firmware and kernel must support partitioning (latest recommended).
- `amd-smi` tool is required for runtime management.
- Bare-metal OS installation—no virtualization layer.
